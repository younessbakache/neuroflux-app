Model1:
- Architecture: Model1 uses the ResNet50 architecture as a base model with the pre-trained weights from ImageNet. It adds a global average pooling layer, a dense layer with 1024 units, and a final dense layer with 5 units for classification.
- Training: The model is trained using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 and categorical cross-entropy loss. It is trained for 10 epochs.
- Evaluation: The model is evaluated using the evaluate method, which loads the saved model and calculates the loss and accuracy on the validation set.
- Prediction: The predict method loads the saved model, preprocesses the input image, and predicts the class label of the input image.

Model2:
- Architecture: Model2 is a sequential model with a simpler architecture. It consists of two convolutional layers with max pooling, followed by a flatten layer, a dense layer with 128 units, a dropout layer, and a final dense layer with 5 units for classification.
- Training: The model is trained using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 and categorical cross-entropy loss. It is trained for 10 epochs.
- Evaluation: The model is evaluated similarly to Model1.
- Prediction: The prediction method is the same as in Model1.

Improvements for the models:
1. Data augmentation: Applying additional data augmentation techniques, such as rotation, scaling, and shearing, can help increase the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.
2. Hyperparameter tuning: Experimenting with different learning rates, optimizer choices, batch sizes, and number of epochs can improve the model's performance. Techniques like learning rate schedules or early stopping can also be employed.
3. Model architecture modifications: Both models can benefit from architectural changes. For Model1, fine-tuning some of the layers in the base model instead of freezing them may improve performance. For Model2, increasing the depth of the network or using a more sophisticated architecture, such as a pre-trained model like VGG16 or InceptionV3, may yield better results.
